## How it works

1. Capture your UK income components (base salary, bonus, stock awards) and pension contributions. [file:21]
2. Capture your India‑sourced income (rental, dividends, FD interest, mutual fund capital gains). [file:21]
3. The tool estimates:
   - UK income tax, National Insurance and pension impact. [file:21]
   - India tax on NRO income, TDS, and net India income. [file:21]
   - DTAA credit available in the UK and residual UK tax on India income. [file:21]
4. It then maps your situation to recommended accounts and instruments in each country, with priority flags and compliance notes. [file:21]
5. Finally, it highlights optimisation steps (e.g. “Max ISA first”, “Prefer NRE over NRO”, “File Form 10F to reduce TDS”). [file:21]

All figures are **illustrative** and based on standard rules; users should confirm details with a qualified tax professional in both jurisdictions. [file:21]
